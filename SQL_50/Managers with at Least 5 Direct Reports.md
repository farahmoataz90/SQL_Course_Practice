## Problem Description

You are given an `Employee` table with the following structure:

### Employee Table

```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |
| department  | varchar |
| managerId   | int     |
+-------------+---------+
```

- `id` is the primary key for this table.
- `name` is the name of the employee.
- `department` is the department of the employee.
- `managerId` is the ID of the employee's manager. If `managerId` is null, then the employee does not have a manager.

### Objective

Write a SQL query to find managers with at least five direct reports. A direct report is an employee whose `managerId` matches the `id` of the manager.

### Example

**Input:**

Employee table:
```
+-----+-------+------------+-----------+
| id  | name  | department | managerId |
+-----+-------+------------+-----------+
| 101 | John  | A          | null      |
| 102 | Dan   | A          | 101       |
| 103 | James | A          | 101       |
| 104 | Amy   | A          | 101       |
| 105 | Anne  | A          | 101       |
| 106 | Ron   | B          | 101       |
+-----+-------+------------+-----------+
```

**Output:**
```
+------+
| name |
+------+
| John |
+------+
```

**Explanation:**
- John (id 101) is the manager of Dan, James, Amy, Anne, and Ron. Therefore, John has 5 direct reports.

## Solution

```sql
SELECT E.name 
FROM Employee AS E
JOIN Employee AS M
ON E.id = M.managerId 
GROUP BY E.id
HAVING COUNT(M.managerId) >= 5;
```

### Explanation

1. **JOIN**: Join the `Employee` table with itself to find the relationships between managers and their direct reports. Specifically, this join matches employees (`E`) with their managers (`M`).
2. **GROUP BY**: Group the results by the manager's `id`.
3. **HAVING**: Use the `HAVING` clause to filter the groups to include only those managers who have at least 5 direct reports. The `COUNT(M.managerId)` counts the number of direct reports for each manager.
4. **SELECT**: Select the `name` of the managers who meet the criteria.

### Notes

- The solution uses a self-join on the `Employee` table to correlate each employee with their respective manager.
- The `GROUP BY` clause ensures that the counting of direct reports is done correctly for each manager.
- The `HAVING` clause filters out managers with fewer than 5 direct reports, ensuring that only those with 5 or more are included in the result.
